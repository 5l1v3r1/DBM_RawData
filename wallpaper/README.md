# Wallpaper Command
I saw this command requested in the raw data archive twice, so I decided to make it.

This command grabs a random wallpaper from Abyss Wallpapers.
You will have to edit action #3 and add your API key from here: https://wall.alphacoders.com/api.php

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
