# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a game of Rock Paper Scissors! You and your friend can play and determine who the _real_ winner in life is!

To play, simply mention a member of the server and watch the responses from the bot. You and your partner will choose either rock, paper, or scissors. (obviously)

Usage: [p]rps @user

If you encounter any errors that I did not see, please DM me!

Known Bug: If both players choose rock it will give an error, but still say tied.

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
Note 2: You have to have my updated version for check if member mod if you want to use action 8-10, otherwise safely delete those.
